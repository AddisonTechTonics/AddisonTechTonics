- 👋 Hi, I’m @AddisonTechTonics

- 👀 I’m interested in: Tech related stuff -> Web Development, Game Development, General Programming. Non-tech related stuff -> Science, Economics, Philosophy, World Peace, Ending Poverty, Creating a world where we can automate a job without the risk of former employees having to starve.
                        
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: Secure access & storage of MySQL data with PHP, C++, Godot Engine with GDScript, advanced use of linux, etc.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: Anything worth contributing to really. I want to see my code used in-real-life. Ideally, I want to contribute towards something I believe in. Something that can make society a better place. I'll settle for something useful or marketable, but my real dreams are centered around societal change.
