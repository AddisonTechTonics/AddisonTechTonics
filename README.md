- 👋 Hi, I’m @AddisonTechTonics

- 👀 I’m interested in: Tech related stuff (most interested to least) -> GNU/Linux development and ecosystem, Web Development, Game Development, General Programming. 
- 👀 Non-tech related interests (no particular order) -> Science, Economics, Philosophy, World Peace, Ending Poverty, Creating a world where we can automate mass amounts of jobs without sentencing economic doom on mass amounts of people.
                        
- 🌱 I was learning: Secure access & storage of MySQL data with PHP, C++, Godot Engine with GDScript, advanced use of linux, etc. (06/022)
- 🌱 I'm now learning: The Laravel framework, Unix architectural design, API implimentation, and how to build custom cfx.re servers (09/2022)

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: Anything worth contributing to really. I want to see my code used in-real-life. Ideally, I want to contribute towards something I believe in. Something that can make society a better place. I'll settle for something useful or marketable, but my real dreams are centered around societal change.
